# üé¨ **Movie Recommendation System**

This is a simple **Movie Recommendation System** built using **Streamlit** and The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on user-selected input. For each recommended movie, the system also fetches and displays the movie posters.

---

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Select a Movie**: Choose a movie title from a dropdown menu.
- **Movie Recommendations**: Get a list of 5 recommended movies similar to the selected movie.
- **Poster Display**: View the posters of the recommended movies using the TMDb API.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web app.
- **Pickle**: For loading pre-processed movie data and similarity matrices.
- **TMDb API**: To fetch movie poster images dynamically.

---

## üìÅ **File Structure**

- `app.py`: The main script to run the Streamlit app.
- `movies_list.pkl`: Pickle file containing the list of movies.
- `similarity.pkl`: Pickle file storing the similarity matrix for movie recommendations.
- **API Key**: TMDb API key is hardcoded into the app for fetching movie posters.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone or Download** the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/movie-recommendation-system
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit requests pandas
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the **local web URL** generated by Streamlit, e.g., `http://localhost:8501`.

## üåê **API Configuration**

The application uses **TMDb API** to fetch movie posters. If you want to replace the existing API key or use your own:

- **Get your API Key**:
   - Sign up at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - Go to your account settings and generate an API key.
- Replace the hardcoded API key in the `fetch_poster()` function:
   ```python
   url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&language=en-US".format(movie_id)
   ```

## üß© **How It Works**

1. **Input**: The user selects a movie title from the dropdown.
2. **Recommendation Logic**:
   - The app identifies the selected movie's index in the data.
   - It retrieves the top 5 most similar movies using the `similarity` matrix.
3. **Poster Fetching**:
   - Using TMDb API, the poster paths for the recommended movies are fetched and displayed.
4. **Output**: Titles and posters of the recommended movies appear in a row.

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure `streamlit`, `requests`, and `pandas` libraries are installed.
- **API Errors**: Verify your TMDb API key and ensure your internet connection is active.
- **File Loading**: Confirm that `movies_list.pkl` and `similarity.pkl` are present in the project directory.
